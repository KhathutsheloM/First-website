                    <p> My name is Magodi Khathutshelo well known by my stage name Catterlog,
                        I come from a small village in Limpopo called Hamapila. <P>
  
  
                        <p> Passion for music started years ago , when i was still in primary and
                        my inspiration came from local rappers as wel as international rappers.
  
                        Due to unpreviledge background it took me more than six full years to find a 
                        proper studio and potray my art.<p>
  
                        In 2014 i became a member of the group Young Stunnaz which was co-founded by
                        myself and friends. We recorded our first mixtape together titled First Degree
                        of Fame

                         our first bookings , Young Stunnaz became a recognized crew in the Nzhelele
